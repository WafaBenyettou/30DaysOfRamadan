## Todays challenge description [ Breed Counting  ] :

Farmer John's N cows, conveniently numbered 1…N, are all standing in a row (they seem to do so often that it now takes very little prompting from Farmer John to line them up). Each cow has a breed ID: 1 for Holsteins, 2 for Guernseys, and 3 for Jerseys. Farmer John would like your help counting the number of cows of each breed that lie within certain intervals of the ordering.

### INPUT FORMAT (file bcount.in):
    The first line of input contains N
    and Q (1≤N≤100,000, 1≤Q≤100,000).

The next N

lines contain an integer that is either 1, 2, or 3, giving the breed ID of a single cow in the ordering.

The next Q
lines describe a query in the form of two integers a,b (a≤b

).

### OUTPUT FORMAT (file bcount.out):

    For each of the Q
    queries (a,b), print a line containing three numbers: the number of cows numbered a…b
    that are Holsteins (breed 1), Guernseys (breed 2), and Jerseys (breed 3).
