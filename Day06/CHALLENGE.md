 ##### ” وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ ۖ أُجِيب دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا بِى لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ 
 ##### “ And when My servants ask you regarding Me [they should know that], I am near and I answer the prayer of the one who prays when they pray to me, therefore, they should respond to Me and have faith in Me, in order that they may be led aright.

## Todays challenge description [ Who is Taller ?! ] :

Chef likes strings a lot but moreover he likes good strings. Chef calls a string str a good string if str starts and ends at different characters. For eg : strings such as abab , baccba , abc are all good strings whereas strings like aba, baab , baacaab are not good at all .

Today, Chef has a special string P consisting of lower case letters "c" , "h" , "e" and "f" only. Chef wants to make some queries about his string P.

Each of chef's query has the following form a b L R. For a given query, Chef wants to count the number of good strings which starts at letter a and ends at letter b such that starting index Si and ending index Ei of a chosen substring satisfies L <= Si < Ei <= R.

NOTE

Two substrings P1 and P2 are considered to be different if either S1 != S2 or E1 != E2 where S1,E1 and S2,E2 are the starting and ending index of string P1 and string P2 respectively.

Chef is not able to accomplish this task efficiently. Can you help him ?

### Input Format

   
    First line of the input contains a string P denoting the chef's special string. Next line of the input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of chef's queries. Next Q lines of the input contains four space separated parameters where the first two parameters are characters denoting a and b respectively and rest two are integers denoting L and R respectively. 




### Output Format

For each chef's query, print the required answer.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤1000
            100≤Y,X≤200
            X≠Y

           

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2 |B|
|150 160|A|
|160 150| |



### Warning

Large test data set, Prefer to use faster input/output methods .

### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: good strings are ch , checfch , cfch , ch

 - **Test case 2**:  good strings are checf , checfchef , checfcheff , cf , cfchef , cfcheff , chef , cheff
