King loves to go on tours with his friends.

King has **NNN** cars that can seat **555** people each and **MMM** cars that can seat **777** people each. Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.
### Input Format

    The first line of input contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM — the number of 555-seaters and 777-seaters, respectively.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.
Constraints

                                        1≤T≤100
                                        0≤N,M≤1000 

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 4 |76|
|4 8|101|
|2 13|105|
|14 5|96|
|8 8  | |

### Explanation:

 - Test case 111: King has 444 cars that seat 555 each and 888 cars that seat 777 each. So,  4×5+8×7=76people can travel together.

 - Test case 222: King has 222 cars that seat 555 each and 131313 cars that seat 777 each. So, 2×5+13×7=101 people can travel together.

 - Test case 333: King has 141414 cars that seat 555 each and 555 cars that seat 777 each. So,14×5+7×7=105 people can travel together.

 - Test case 444: King has 888 cars that seat 555 each and 888 cars that seat 777 each. So, 8×5+8×7=96 people can travel together.
