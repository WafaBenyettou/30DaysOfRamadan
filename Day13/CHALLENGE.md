##### ” التَّحِيَّاتُ للهِ، وَالصَّلَوَاتُ، وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ. أّشَْدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ

##### “ All greetings of humility are for Allah, and all prayers and goodness. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. ”

## Todays challenge description [  NWAYS ] :

Devu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point (c,d) from point (a,b) in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point (c,d) from the point (a,b) using abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d) steps only.

Devu has two sets of points. Set A contains points having X co-ordinate 0 and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Set B contains points having X co-ordinate K and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Both sets contains N number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set B from the each point of set A .

As the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007.

### Input Format

    • First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.
    • Next T lines will contain pair of integers N and K

### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.

### Constraints

Subtask #1: 10 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 1000
Subtask #2: 10 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 106
Subtask #3: 80 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ N,K ≤ 106

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2     | 8      |
| 2 2   | 236    |
| 4 5   |        |

### Explanation:

- **Test case 1**:For the first sample case,

        ways[(0,1)->(2,1)]= 1

        ways[(0,2)->(2,2)]= 1

        ways[(0,1)->(2,2)]= 3

        ways[(0,2)->(2,1)]= 3

### ADVICE 💖

Google and ChatGPT can be your so called "best friends" but it won't get you anywhere <3 Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are for the weakest of us all ;)
